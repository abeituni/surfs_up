## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis was to gather temperature data for what could be assumed as the coldest & warmest months in Oahu; June & December. With this analysis, we will be able to determine whether a surf & ice cream shop will be sustainable year-round.

## Results
-The average temperature in Oahu during the month of June was about 75 degrees fahrenheit.
-The average temperature in Oahu during the month of December was about 71 degrees fahrenheit.
-There was a sufficeint amount of data for both months, since we were pulling data from multiple years. These months suprisingly didn't have too big of a difference in temperatures after analyzing the data. 

## Summary
In conclusion, we can determine a surf & ice cream shop in Oahu would be sustainble year-round. We looked at over 3,000 data points. Two additional quieries we can research to seal the deal would be to look at overall temperature data for the entire year. In additon, we can research the average number of days throughout the year that are rainy or windy.
